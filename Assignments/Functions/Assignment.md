## Closure Function
Use closure to have a private array of students and provide API to add, remove, and display students...dont allow duplicate students! Also, provide a **callback** when creating a user, so that one may perform some action after the student was created (potentially hand the callback whether the user was created or not)

**@example**
>	toast.make()
